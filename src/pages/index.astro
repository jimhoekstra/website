			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p class="pe-5">
				My name is Jim Hoekstra. I like exploring the possibilities of using machine learning
				and (software) engineering to solve real-world problems. In my current position at Wageningen
				University & Research I am applying these technologies to the food domain, focusing among
				other things on research towards improving personalized nutritional advice.
			</p>

			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p class="pe-5">
				I graduated from the MSc program Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam.
				My thesis was on the topic of reinforcement learning applied to multi-agent cooperative 
				environments. The goal was to increase the capability of agents to learn to model and 
				cooperate with other (adapting) agents in the environment.
